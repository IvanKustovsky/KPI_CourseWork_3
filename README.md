# KPI Course Work 3 Year

This repository contains the source code for my project developed as a coursework in my third year.

## Project Description

The project focuses on "Accounting by a TV company for the cost of advertising that was aired." It is implemented using JavaFX for creating the graphical user interface (GUI), and MySQL serves as the underlying database. The database design incorporates various SQL objects such as triggers, stored procedures, custom functions, views, and cursors.

To improve organization and make it easier to maintain, the project uses the DAO (Data Access Object) pattern for smooth interaction with the database.
